DESCRIPTION
This is my readme file for my project 0x0F. C - Function pointers
It contains the project requirements, basic instructions
and project task files

Read or watch:

Function Pointer in C
Pointers to functions
Function Pointers in C / C++
why pointers to functions?
Everything you need to know about pointers in C
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are function pointers and how to use them
What does a function pointer exactly hold
Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

Tasks
0. What's my name

1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done

2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities

3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at

	3-calc.h
	3-op_functions.c

This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):

op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);

	3-get_op_func.c
	3-main.c


4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker
